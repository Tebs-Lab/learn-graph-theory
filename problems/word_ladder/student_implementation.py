def construct_word_ladder_graph(word_list):
    '''
    Given a list of words (all of which are assumed to be the same length) construct
    a graph that can be used to solve the word_ladder_problem. Specifically your
    graph should have a single node for every word in the word list, and an edge that
    connects nodes if the two words are different by exactly one letter.

    Given a list of allowed words (word_list), a start_word, and a stop_node
    determine if the words can be laddered. If so, return that ladder, if not
    return None.
