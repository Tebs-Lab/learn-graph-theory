# Graph Algorithms

This folder aspires to contains implementations of key graph algorithm. Each folder corresponds to a class of algorithm (currently only search is implemented). For each class of algorithm, we provide tests, reference implementations, and a stub for students to implement. Each class can contain several individual algorithms; search includes BFS, DFS, and will include Dijkstra's algorithm and A* in a future update.
